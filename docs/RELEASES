  - D4mTableOpsIF: add new method
	public List<String> getTabletLocationsForSplits(String tableName,List<String> splits) throws D4mException;

  - D4mDbTableOperations:
    - Modified getSplits(String tableName) to return String [], instead of String
        String [0]  is string with splits names, as comma-delimited list
        String [1]  is the number of splits per split name,as a comma-delimited list
        String [2]  is the names of the tablet servers associated to split names, a comma-delimited list

    -  A new method
       public String[] getAllSplitsInfo(String tableName)


  - Modify AccumuloTableOperations.java
     - Get the tablet servers names associated to splits -
	public List<String> getTabletLocationsForSplits(String tableName,List<String> splits) throws D4mException;

Version 2.2.0

Needed to separate Accumulo and BigTableLike references in order to make
 2 different releases of D4M (accumulo only and BigTableLike only).
   - Remove any references to Accumulo and BigTableLike package names from D4mDbTableOperations.java.
   - Move the Combining Column code out of D4mDbTableOperations, since these are Accumulo specific.
   - Changes to DbInfoIF - add setConnectionProp method
   - Changes D4mTableOpsIF - add the Combining columns functions
     - Combining columns functionalities are not implemented in BigTableLikeTableOperations.

   - Refactor packages names - add edu.mit.ll.dm4.db.cloud.accumulo and edu.mit.ll.d4m.db.cloud.bigtablelike
      - Moved all Accumulo and BigTableLike specific classes to the appropriate packages.

   - The build system will make 3  jars - D4M_API_JAVA,  D4M_API_JAVA_AC (accumulo) and 
     D4M_API_JAVA_BigTableLike (BigTableLike). 
      - D4M_API_JAVA.jar is the common jar.
      - D4M_API_JAVA_AC.jar contains the accumulo specific classes.
      - D4M_API_JAVA_BigTableLike.jar contains the BigTableLike specific classes.

Version 2.0.2

Migrating from Accumulo-1.3.5-incubating to Accumulo-1.4.0
  - Changed TableOperations from class to interface.
     All calls for TableOpertions by the Connector resulted in casting the object to TableOperationsImpl. 
     See AccumuloTableOperations.java

  - ScannerBase had deprecate methods - setScanIterators and setScanIteratorOption.
    In 1.4, you have to use IteratorSettings object to set the ScanIterator, then
    use the addScanIterator() method to add the IteratorSetting. In the IteratorSettings' object
    you use the addOption() method to add options.

  Must call the close method on the BatchWriter.

Version 2.0.0
-  Port code to Accumulo
   - Implement new interfaces to allow switching between BigTableLike or Accumulo.
     - D4mConfig
        - configuration class to switch between BigTableLike or Accumulo.
        - setCloudType method
     - D4mParent: base class

         -D4mDbInfo
         -D4mDbInsert
         -D4mDbTableOperations
         - D4mParentQuery
            - D4mParentQuery  base class for query objects

              - D4mDbQueryAccumulo
              - D4mDbQueryBigTableLike

            - D4mDataSearch :  replaces D4mDbQuery
               - This class is called from d4m_api matlab code to execute queries
               - This class acts like a wrapper class to wrap the functionality of 
                 D4mDbQueryBigTableLike and D4mDbQueryAccumulo


     - AccumuloConnection
       - Similar to BigTableLike connection
       - use the ConnectionProperties class to hold info to access cloud

     - D4mInsertBase   base class
        - AccumuloInsert
        - BigTableLikeInsert

     - D4mFactory; factory class to create the child classes for inserting, querying, table operations
 
     - BigTableLikeTableOperations
     - AccumuloTableOperations

-  D4mDbQuery.java was modified to allow for iterating a batch of results.
One can make successive calls to next() to get another batch of results.
For example, if your query returns a millions of results, you can get batches
of 100 results returned to you.
